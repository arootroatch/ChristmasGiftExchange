# Gift Exchange Generator

Drawing names for the digital age!

1. Add participants' names
2. Easily and visually sort them into exclusion groups
3. Generate the list
4. Email each participant their recipient

You can even use your email to look up who your recipient is!

## But what's wrong with using a hat?

Because hats don't work if you're scattered across the country!

Not only that, having one person draw names on behalf of every one participating ruins the surprise of Secret Santa. 

What if you get paired with your significant other? You're buying gifts for each other outside of the gift exchange; you shouldn't be able to get each other's names!

This keeps Secret Santa secret and allows you to group people together so they won't draw each other's names! 

## Quick Start

Navigate to https://giftexchangegenerator.netlify.app/ to do your own gift exchange!
