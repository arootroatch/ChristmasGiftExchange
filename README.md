You can even use your email to look up who your recipient is!

## But what's wrong with using a hat?

Because hats don't work if you're scattered across the country!

Not only that, having one person draw names on behalf of every one participating ruins the surprise of Secret Santa. 

What if you get paired with your significant other? You're buying gifts for each other outside of the gift exchange; you shouldn't be able to get each other's names!

With Secret Santa Mode, this keeps Secret Santa secret, and you can group people together so they won't draw each other's names! 

## Quick Start

Navigate to https://giftexchangegenerator.netlify.app/ to do your own gift exchange!

## Noteworthy Features

### Conditional Rendering
Elements and layouts are displayed on the page as-needed based on what step the user has completed and whether they are in Secret Santa Mode. 

### Recursion
Generating the randomized list is done with a recursive function to account for the randomization potentially not resulting in a viable result the first time. After 25 attempts to find a viable combination, the recursive loop is broken and an error is sent to the user.

### Framework Free

This app was built entirely using plain ol' HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are no third party libraries, pre-processors, or frameworks at play here!

### Serverless Functions
This app uses Netlify Serverless Functions to create and read data in the MongoDB Atlas cluster and send data to Postmark for email sending.

### Error Handling
Errors are communicated to the user through a custom CSS snackbar/toast-style notification that automatically disappears after 5 seconds. Error handling includes:

- Not letting the user progress without completing necessary steps
- Detection of duplicate names
- No possible combinations of names given the amount/groupings
