## But what's wrong with using a hat?

For Christmas, the adults in my family draw names for our gift exchange. Before I made this, my sister would put everyone's names in a hat and draw names on our behalf, then send us a text message with the results. Not only did that spoil the surprise (because we all knew who got paired with whom), but one year, I got paired with my wife! That didn't make sense to me, because she and I were already buying each other gifts regardless of the family gift exchange. I knew there had to be an easier way, one that would let us keep Secret Santa secret AND stop people from getting matched to their significant others.
